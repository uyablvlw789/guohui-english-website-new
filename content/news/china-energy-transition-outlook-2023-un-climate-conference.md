Xinhua News Agency Dubai, December 10th (Reporters Luo Chen and Wang Yan) The 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) is currently being held here. At a Chinese side event on December 9th, the "China Energy Transition Outlook 2023" report was officially released.

The report made its debut at the Chinese side event themed "Joining Hands to Shape the Future of Global Energy Transition." It focused on China's timely achievement of carbon peaking and neutrality goals, the strategic objectives outlined in the Paris Agreement, and emphasized the analysis of ensuring energy security throughout the low-carbon energy transition process. It also highlighted the optimal pathways to achieve better cost-effectiveness.

Xie Zhenhua, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change Affairs, emphasized during the meeting the crucial need to explore optimal transformation pathways tailored to the specific conditions of each country. He expressed expectations for deep analysis by expert think tanks on global commonalities, systematic challenges, and proposing forward-thinking and innovative solutions for energy transformation. These efforts aim to contribute more wisdom and strength to the comprehensive implementation of the Paris Agreement and the global green and low-carbon transformation.

Lü Wenbin, Director of the Energy Research Institute of the China Macroeconomic Research Institute, introduced, "The China Energy Transition Outlook 2023 report reveals that China will embark on a distinctive path of green and low-carbon growth, different from that of developed countries. Major clean energy technologies will experience exponential and leapfrog development. This will support economic and social high-quality development and improve people's living standards with relatively lower per capita energy consumption and carbon emissions compared to developed countries, injecting confidence into global green growth."

Dan Jørgensen, Danish Minister for Development Cooperation and Climate Policy, noted the significance of the "China Energy Transition Outlook 2023" report as an important outcome of Danish-Chinese governmental cooperation. He stated that the report outlines China's path towards energy transformation and provides direction for achieving carbon neutrality goals. He emphasized that global efforts for energy green transformation are crucial, with China playing a pivotal role in actively driving this vision.

Mary Warlick, Deputy Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, highlighted the rapid emergence of a new clean energy economy, with China making significant contributions to accelerating this process.
