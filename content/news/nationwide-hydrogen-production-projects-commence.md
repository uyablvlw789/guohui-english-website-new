### Datang's 150,000-kilowatt Integrated Wind-Hydrogen Demonstration Project

On November 22, 2023, the construction of Datang's 150,000-kilowatt integrated wind-hydrogen demonstration project commenced in Duolun County.

The project mainly includes the construction of electrolytic hydrogen production units, spherical hydrogen storage tanks, hydrogen compressors, and auxiliary circulating water facilities. With a hydrogen production scale of 5,419 tons/year, it will provide all raw materials to Datang Duolun Coal Chemical Industry. This achievement marks the breakthrough in the transformation of 'Three-In-One' - green electricity, green hydrogen, and green coal chemical industry. It paves the way for the coupling of green electricity with chemical industries, actively promotes the replacement of energy sources, facilitates high proportions of new energy consumption on-site, and supports cost reduction, energy conservation, carbon reduction, and green transformation, aiming to forge a new path for the transformation and development of resource-based areas.

### Lanze Energy's Annual 300,000 Tons Green Methanol Project Officially Commences

On November 20, Lanze Energy's annual 300,000 tons green methanol project officially commenced in Jiangsu Dafeng Port Economic Development Zone. With a planned total investment of 2.25 billion yuan, this project will use agricultural waste as raw materials, employing proprietary green methanol production technology and high-level catalyzers. It innovatively develops biomass gasification production units and green methanol production units while using green electricity throughout the process to produce biomass green methanol.

The commencement of this project not only responds positively to the national dual-carbon policy but also signifies Dafeng's impending status as a leading international base for biomass green marine fuels.

### Kashgar Photovoltaic Hydrogen Production Integrated Demonstration Project Commences

On November 15, the groundbreaking ceremony for the Kashgar Photovoltaic Hydrogen Production Integrated Demonstration Project was held in Bachu, marking a solid step towards constructing the hydrogen energy industrial chain in Kashgar.

Relying on local advantages in green electricity resources, Bachu County plans to advance the hydrogen energy industry chain development focusing on 'photovoltaic green electricity for hydrogen production + hydrogen energy public transportation + hydrogen energy logistics + cottonseed-based biojet fuel + hydrogen energy storage power stations + hydrogen energy equipment manufacturing.' It aims to gradually scale up the hydrogen energy industry, demonstrating a significant role in promoting the 'green electricity at a low cost for hydrogen production' nationwide.

### State Power Investment Engineering Northwest Institute's Yingjisha Hydrogen Energy Production Integration Station Demonstration Project Commences

On November 15, the groundbreaking ceremony for the State Power Investment Engineering Northwest Institute's Yingjisha Hydrogen Energy Production Integration Station Demonstration Project was launched in the Green Building Materials Industrial Park. Covering an area of approximately 3,300 square meters with a planned total investment of 10 million yuan, the project will adopt a set of 500Nm3/h electrolytic hydrogen production equipment, producing 4.32 million cubic meters of hydrogen annually, equivalent to 386 tons/year. After completion, it will produce 925 million kilowatt-hours of green electricity annually, with a daily hydrogenation capacity of 500 kilograms, catering to the daily hydrogenation needs of 10 hydrogen energy heavy-duty trucks or 25 hydrogen energy buses. This project boasts significant economic, social, and ecological benefits, representing a landmark demonstration project of 'green sunshine.'

### Xinjiang's Tacheng 500,000-kilowatt Wind Power Scale Hydrogen Production Project Commences

On November 15, the concentrated groundbreaking ceremony for Xinjiang's Tacheng Region's 2023 new energy projects, including the Shanghai Hangrong Toli County's 500,000-kilowatt wind power scale hydrogen production project, was held in Toli Industrial Park. The five projects launched include Sany Heavy Energy's 500,000-kilowatt wind power project in Tacheng, Shanghai Hangrong's 500,000-kilowatt wind power project in Toli County, Goldwind Science and Technology's 800,000-kilowatt experimental wind power project in Toli County, Tacheng Tianrun Wind Power's '49.5 thousand kilowatt renovation + 50 thousand kilowatt capacity expansion' project, and Xinhua Power's 700,000-kilowatt photovoltaic project in Shawan City.
